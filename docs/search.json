Your Code\n\nAny R script can be submitted to SwissStatsR.\nOur only requirement is to be open source and related to Swiss Statistics.\nMake a submission using the form or by email.\n\n\n\n2. GitHub Private\n\nOnce your submission is accepted, peer reviewing starts with SwissStatsR members.\nYou should have an account on GitHub.\nHosting on our SwissStatsR GitHub is recommended but not mandatory.\n\n\n\n3. GitHub Public\n\nR packages and R projects (see next sections) can be hosted on any GitHub repository, including SwissStatsR GitHub, or another DevOps public provider1.\nThey should have an GitHub Action R-CMD-Check badge:\n\nusethis::use_github_action()\n\nThey should have an open source license such as MIT, GPL or LGPL:\n\nfor example: usethis::use_gpl3_license()\n\n\n\n\n4.

Even if your project is not an R package, this file helps us standardize metadata collection among all SwissStatsR projects, such as contacts and licensing.\nYou can create the DESCRIPTION file with:\nusethis::use_description()\nThen you should fill DESCRIPTION file. You can use utility functions as helpers, such as:\n\nadd authors: usethis::use_author()\nadd license: usethis::use_gpl3_license(), usethis::use_mit_license(), etc.\n\nWe ask you to also add R package dependencies of your R project. As a helper, you can use usethis::use_package().\n\n\n/R folder\nWe strongly recommend to have all the R function in the /R folder, following R package guidelines. Some reasons are:\n\nWith devtools::load_all(), it is really easy to setup the environment.\nEveryone knows where to find the functions.\nThis folder structure is the standard for R packages, but also for other projects such as golem (R shiny) and targets.\n\n\n\n/tests folder\nAll tests should be in the /tests folder. More information about tests can be found (here)[https://r-pkgs.org/testing-basics.html].\n\n\nOther files\nOther R scripts and files can be added to the /inst and /scripts folders.\nIf for some reasons the R projects cannot follow an R package structure, all the other files and folders should be listed in the .Rbuildignore file. For this you can use:\nusethis::use_build_ignore()\nIf you R project contains R functions and tests, we recommend you to add them in the “R” and “tests” folder and follow R package guidelines.\n\n\n.gitignore file\nYou can avoid sharing specific files and folder using the .gitignore file, in particular sensitive files.\nPlease note as you are the only responsible of the data shared on GitHub.\n\n\nrenv\nWe strongly recommend you to use renv to track the dependencies of your R project with snapshots. Snapshots should be done using the most R version possible.\nrenv::init()\nYou can choose to add a specific badge in the README showing your R project is fully reproducible using renv.\n\n\nChecks\nEven if your R project is not an R package, we ask you to add GitHub Actions R-CMD-Check to check if your DESCRIPTIONS and .Rbuildignore files are correctly filled. For this, please use usethis::use_github_action(name = \"check-standard\")\nYou can locally check your R project R-CMD-Check results with: devtools::check().\nSwissStatsR hosts only R projects passing all R-CMD-Checks.\n\nClick here to make a submission"
